It provides vets to have an all-in-one hub to setup appointments, provide patient care, and manage all other important aspects of their medical procedures; 
MiVet is an MVP and due to the propreitary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code. 

This repository contains SQL, .NET, and REACT code for the user login/register features as well as the Google Analytics service;
